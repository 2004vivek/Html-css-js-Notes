computer networking
1.physical
2.logical

websites---submarinecable.com

the cables are fibre optics cable

workgroup model--no security,no centralised adminstration

client-server--centralises adminstration

go to command terminal 

ipconfig  ---to see the ip address of the system 


wifi--wirless federality

//to show the no of network connection
ncpa.cpl

how to share the directory

1.right cick property sharing select everyone advances sharing enable (share the folder) change the permissin

sharing is done in order the access the files enable the servic3s

go to advances sharing setting 
first click on private option make all the option is on
then go the public make sure all the option is on
all network -leave as it


to access the file

i will give my ip address

\\10.23.114.34

client server sharing

rdp--remote desktop protocol

give the access - take the access


in networking 
there is 
end devices-pc,laptop--is devices which user used
intermediatory devices--switches,routers  ---through which the connection happen 
connections - wired ,wireless

group of entheranat combine is called internet


cable network

microsoft--NetBios is a protocol through which they communicate with each other

apple--appletalk(protocol)

unix/novel----ipx/spx

when the concept of globalization i.e everyone has to communicate with everyone/everyone should communicate with other


in this ways protocol suite(which consists all kind of protocol) came into picture ---->tcp/ip-->it consists of all the protocol i.e everyone can communication with other
so then after every operating system is having tcp/ip

tracert ----run in cmd  ----tracking how the communication happens and how many intermediatry device having in communciation it tracks the path from your laptop to destination laptop or it traces through which route,which
router it is taking it to the destination

netstat---show the connection which are already established application with your computer

Tcp/ip protocol model--layer by which data transfer from source and destination
1.application
2.internet
3.transport
4.networkaccess

Osi(open system interconnection) Layer/Model--

1.application--which kind of application which we are using for data transfer eg.whatsapp calling

2.presentation--suppose we are sharing txt,images will be encoded into machine understanble language and as well it will encrypt the information eg--whatsapp end to end encyption

3.Session layer--establish the conection b/w source and destination

4.Transport--whatever the audio ,videos will turn into segment/part it will be identify the kind of information and it divide into different parts it will be chooped some part of information and also add sequence number to every segment eg-we are sharing 1Gb of data then it will share 1mb of data 

1 h1           4 you

2 how          1 hi 

3 are          2 how

4 you         3 are



5.network layer--decides through ip's data is sharing from source to destination and it add ip's address to all(source and destination address) the segment in the form packet (header(source ip/destination ip),data))

6.Data link--add MacAddress to source and destination address

1024 msg(frame) is sealed by trailer


encapsulation happens in the source

decapsulation happen in the destination

7.Physical layer-- 
in physical layer start with end device and end device should have network port(wired or wirless) 
//to view the list of port
devmgmt.msc


port --->cable - is called connection


ethernet port is called as rj-45port(registered jack)/network port

fastethernet-10/100Mbps(Megabits)(connected to computer/laptop)

gigabitethernet--(connected to hub)

ethernet cable -2types
passes data into the electrical signals-0 1

1.UTP--Un-shielded twisted pair

purpose--is used in indoor cablings and having less protection

green-->green
       w.green  simarily for all 3 wires

total 8 wire and 4 pair

ethernet cable cannot be connected directly we can do it rj-45 pin


2.STP--shielded twisted pair

purpose--outdoor cablings and having more protection


color coding

we have two standard for color coding --T568A--out of 8 wire are 1,2,3,6 transfered the data and remaninig are for the suppport purpose 

                                      --T568B  

Use of T568A vs T568B


T568A----communicating with-----T568A

T568B----communicating with-----T568B

straight cable-the one end of the cable follow the one cable code and other end of cable also follow the same cable code

it is used when both side have different devices


Cross cable--the one end of the cable follow the different cable code and other end of cable also follow the different cable code


it is used when both side have same devices

T568A----communicating with-----T568B

T568B----communicating with-----T568A

unicasting device---->connection from one computer to another computer

brodcastingdevice--->connection to all computer ,leads to security threats

Hub

hub is broadcasting device (layer1 device)/(half duplex device)

it can either recieves or send the data at the same time or one way communication

Hub operates at physical layer/layer1 device

these problem are solved by switch

Switch ---operates at layer-2(datalink layer) 

It is unicasting device 

It is full-duplex due to which the performance increases

switch works on macaddress rather than signal 

red---icmp----happens second---unicast (is used for ping )

blue---arp(address resolution protocol)---happens first----broadcasting (it is sending packets to everyone) 

Datalink-layer-----Mac Address(Media Access Control)/Physical Address

(Switch is layer2 device)i.e called as data link layer

Switch intially doesnot have the operating system installed in it  and doesnot the any information i.e ping to get the destination mac address and it will flood the packets to everyone and then switch will the create an table containing port number and ip's
i.e mapping macaddress to ip and second time it will send packets to known ip's


Switch --2 typess

unmanaged Switch-----switches which are of low cost and no configuration is required 

managed switch----these switch can have customized configuration

cisco switches have operating system (cisco ios)

console cable -----
one end is a ethernet port(rj45)(connect switch)-----serialport(rs232)(connect computer) 

3 modes that are avaliable in switch

        --user execution mode ---no configuration can be made (command-- enable)
          (by using enable command takes me to the privelage mode)

       --privileged execution  command---(it is for verification of the router) 
       configure terminal(this is command to switch to the third mode from second mode)
        //to view the list of interface ---command ---show ip interface brief

        //to the general information of the router --command---show running-config

       command ---hostname sw1

       --whenever we make any changes in the setting we have to run this command to make permanent changes                                                                              then should be done in 2 mode command-------> copy running startup-config

       command ----again--configuree terminal
       command ----interface fastEthernet0/13
       command -----shutdown
       command  ----no shutdown
       command -----to disable the switch all      once ----interface range fastEthernet 0/1-20

--global configuration mode  where actually changes canbe made   

***protect the switch with password***

line console 0(3mode)

password vivek

login

Do these command in  the same location 

then press exit


//Protect the second mode 

1.go to the second mode 

2.enable password <your password>

3.exit

Switch have two storages

1.ram           2.nvram

ram--random access memory------>temporary storage ,running configuration happen in ram

so whenver there is power cut then whatever configuration is done is temporarily stored  

to to save it permananenly in nvram

we can do this in this way in second mode

sw1#copy running-config startup-config 

switch>---first mode

sw1#--->second mode

sw1(configure)#---->third mode(global configuration)

to show the configuration/or to view the password

show running-config (2mode)

nvram-non volatile random access memory---->permanent

cisco ios--is--nvram

//to encryption the password 

service password-encryption



//macaddress command
getmac

//to view ip address and mac address
ipconfig /all

//list of command used
ipconfig
ping
netstat
tracert
ncpa.cpl
devmgmt.msc
getmac
ipconfig /all
services.msc


ethernet can send the signal upto 100mtrs

Repeater---
it works as like the hub in order to increase the signal strength

Switch doesnot understand the ip address and it can understand the mac address .so arp maps mac and ip address


IP ADDRESSING --works at---NETWORK LAYER--i.e 3LAYER

Router works in this layer

Ip address is called as logical address and it can modified 


10.16.59.150 4parts---is called---octates

1 octate-8bits

4 octate-32bits

So IPv4 is 32bit binary address

00000000.00000000.00000000.00000000==0.0.0.0(minimum value)

11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111

1 octat---1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
          7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

         2^7 2^6 2^5 2^4 2^3 2^2 2^1 2^0

128+64....1=255

each octat have minimum value as 0 and maximum value as 255

maximum value ---255.255.255.255


256*256*256*256=4,29,49,67,296 --->total ip address combination these 4 billion ip address is not enough 

ipv6-340 undecillion chart -

ip address classes

classes are of 5 type

A 	B	C	D	E	F

out of which A,B,C class is used for general communication(unicast)
D-is used in multicast 
E-used for R&D purpose, special use,standardard institute(ieee,iso,irtf,eia)

D and E is used for reserved for research and development purpose

A class 0-127
B class 128-191 
C class 192-223

D class 224-230
E class 240-255


we can use ip starting from 0-223 range

1 bit=0 or 1


class A 0-127
N.H.H.H

which is loopback ip address --127.0.0.1

first octat is network octat and remaining is host address

11111111.00000000.00000000.0000000

when the octat is filled with all the 1s is called network octat and all 0s in octat is host octat

255.0.0.0---->subnet mask

no ip is start with 0 ie 0.2.1.1

no of ip we are getting for this network-->256*256-->65000

in class B how many network octat we have--->the first octat start with 128 to 191 so we are getting 64 index position that is applicable for first octat and another octat have 0-255 octat value

so first octat have 64 ranges and second octat have 256 value 

64*256--->16234 networks
